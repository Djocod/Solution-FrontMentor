## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this project I learned a little more about the "click" event with JS.
My second step, I will be able to use Js well, to add a different animation.

### Continued development

In this project, it is the JS part that interests me most. I would like to improve myself in this language, I do not master the different events very well, my goal is to be able to use it fully by the end of the year.
I use a lot of MDN, to document myself, I also follow web developers.
